This study demonstrates a novel approach to integrating Arduino microcontrollers with ROS2 via Bluetooth, using AADL for system modeling. Although detailed performance analysis was not conducted, the successful implementation demonstrates the potencial for this method in robotic systems, addressing a significant gap in existing literature. Future work will explore in-depth testing and expansion of the methodology to enhance the reliability and applicability of Bluetooth communication in robotics, explore more complex applications and improve the robustness of the communication setup.
